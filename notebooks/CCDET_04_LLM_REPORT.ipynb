In particular, values of V4, V6, V8, V10, V15, V17, V18, V19, and V28 should be scrutinized for better flagging efficiency.

These features might be some measures including the person's typical spending behavior, their location, timing or frequency of transactions, or type of purchase made. \n",

      "For example, the high value of 'V3', 'V5', and a low 'V2' could indicate a significant change in transaction attitude‚Äîlike purchasing from high-risk merchants, or making large transactions in a short span of time. Values of 'V6', 'V8', 'V9', 'V10' 'V11', 'V17', 'V18', 'V22', and 'V28' are notably irregular, suggesting patterns commonly associated with fraudulent transactions.
